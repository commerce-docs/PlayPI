# Custom Storefront Components made with React

The `base` components provide all the common components — the bricks and mortar — used to build the three storefront composite components in this example:

- `ProductCategories.jsx`
- `ProductList.jsx`
- `ProductDetails.jsx`

Think of these commerce composite components as pre-built rooms in your storefront house. You can use them as-is or customize them to your liking.

Tailwindcss is used for all component styling in this example.
