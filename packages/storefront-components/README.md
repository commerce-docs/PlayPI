# Storefront components for the storefront demo

You can think of composite components as the larger parts of a storefront that provide shoppers with the expected experiences for online shopping — like a product details page for reading about and selecting product options. Or a cart that displays selected products. Or a checkout page that shows purchasing options. 

The composite components in this package provide three common storefront experiences:

- `ProductCategories.jsx` — A selection of product categories
- `ProductList.jsx` — A summary list of the products within a selected category
- `ProductDetails.jsx` — A display of details and options for a selected product

Tailwindcss is used for all component styling in this example.
