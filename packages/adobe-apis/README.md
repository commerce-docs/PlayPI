# API queries from Adobe Commerce

This package contains the Adobe Commerce GraphQL `Products` queries used to fetch the product categories, product lists, and product details shown in the example React storefront. 

## Products queries used

These links will take you to the docs for the queries used:

- `products` query: <https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/schema/products/queries/products/>

## Storefront usage

The React storefront demo (screenshot below) uses a `categories` query to fetch the product categories and two `products` queries to fetch the product lists and product details for the storefront UI.
